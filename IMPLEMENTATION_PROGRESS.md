## 💡 Implementation Notes

### What's Working Well:
- Modular architecture
- Clean separation of concerns
- Reusable components
- Toast notifications for feedback
- No breaking changes
- Performance optimized

### Challenges Faced:
- Large file sizes (Editor.jsx getting big)
- Need to split into smaller components
- Some features require backend infrastructure

### Solutions Applied:
- Created separate component files (ComponentLibrary)
- Used AnimatePresence for smooth modals
- Implemented efficient state management
- Added keyboard shortcuts for better UX
