## 📝 Technical Notes

### Files Created (Phase 2):
- `client/src/data/components.js`
- `client/src/components/ComponentLibrary.jsx`
- `client/src/data/animations.js`
- `client/src/components/AnimationLibrary.jsx`

### Files Modified:
- `client/src/pages/Editor.jsx` (growing, may need refactoring)

### Potential Refactoring:
- Editor.jsx is getting large (1000+ lines)
- Consider splitting into smaller components
- Extract toolbar to separate component
- Extract modals to separate files
